Smart Locks., Pictures finally worth 1,000 words … when AI meets multifamily!, Chatbots, smart locks, artificial intelligence — HappyCo CEO Jindou Lee breaks down the buzzwords and predicts just where property management tech is heading over the next ten years., HappyCo","Just a decade ago, multifamily property managers were wrangling with fax machines, relying on office phones, and resorting to desktop computers just to navigate their day jobs. For the multifamily business leaders of 2008, it was unimaginable to gather apartment applications online or advertise units without physical signs — let alone to conduct inspections from internet-enabled devices that were perfectly palm-sized. Technology has brought us a long way, but several pain points remain. Scheduling unit inspections and gaining access to apartments (while respecting privacy standards) are largely still manual processes. As online reviews hold more weight than ever, there’s a lot of pressure to get these tasks done quickly. Unfortunately, paper forms make it tough for technicians to have all of the information they need when making the rounds. Luckily, hope is on the horizon! Considerable strides are being made in AI and machine learning. I predict that in the next ten years, these technologies will be able to automate the most burdensome property management tasks. • • • By 2028, I believe chatbots will bear one of your biggest burdens: scheduling inspections. With these AI-powered personal assistants in your corner, coordinating unit visits will go from stressful to seamless. As multifamily managers know well, this task can be incredibly draining. The best time for a resident might already be booked for a technician. Games of phone tag may go on and on, but it’s critical that multifamily managers respect the rules around privacy and security when it comes to entering an occupied unit. Fortunately, the future is happier! Enter: chatbots. I believe there’s much to be gained (time and money) if the property management industry follows in the footsteps of companies using meeting assistant AI technology like X.ai or those getting help from Clara to speedily arrange hiring interviews. After conducting years of natural language research, Google is also a key contender in the chatbot arena. As this playful demo proves, virtual assistant Google Duplex manages to “handle the interaction gracefully” when a scheduling phone call faces a curveball. It might come as a surprise, but chatbots are already being used on business websites in 195 countries; by 2020, they’re expected to support products for 50% of medium to large organizations. Needless to say, this kind of technology could fundamentally improve the multifamily experience. For example, property managers could program the chatbot to ask something like: “when are you available in x-date range for a technician to complete a fire safety inspection?” After securing the resident’s response, the chatbot would then discover the same information from the technician, and boom: the perfect inspection match is made. Should an emergency come up and unravel the chatbot’s efforts, another round of availability requests could follow with ease. Skeptics in the multifamily business could reasonably worry: “will this chatbot sound anything like a person, let alone my brand voice?” Forbes reports a resounding: “yes!” A recent article notes that chatbots have already grown smart enough to reflect specific corporate cultures (and they’ve been known to imitate a wide range of personalities — from Albert Einstein to “How I Met Your Mother” characters). Now’s the time to slash your stress and streamline your scheduling by embracing chatbots. Given such rapid advances in machine-learning technology, I’m confident these bots will be plenty savvy by 2028. • • • By 2028, I bet the price will finally be right for multifamily managers to start embracing… smart locks! While hotels phased out metal keys decades ago, keycards have never really caught on in multifamily communities. Indifference wasn’t the issue, though — steep costs have simply been too much of a turn-off. But Fortune suggests a promising trend in smart lock prices. August is just one top seller pushing to lower its operating costs so that smart locks can replace standard keys once and for all. The company has started dropping prices for popular models, and its CEO has grand plans to keep “going bigger, going wider,” expanding August’s scope beyond wealthy urban markets. Combined with chatbots, this technology would make it much, much easier for multifamily technicians to address major problems quickly. From leaky ceilings to faulty heating, serious concerns could be tackled faster than ever — with chatbots and smart locks ensuring the most efficient path possible from request through repair. As PCMag roundup explains, smart lock administrators can take advantage of a growing range of features like voice activation or geofencing, as well as adding temporary users in a pinch. For multifamily executives, this would spell major savings in time and money, as well as prevent tragedies that can be avoided with timely inspections. Smart lock technology also marries well with a growing trend in package delivery: direct-to-resident delivery, an option HappyCo has covered in previous blogs. With wifi-enabled smart locks, a resident could ensure an expensive package is delivered inside their unit instead of placed in a vulnerable spot within a bustling mailroom. Finally, the switch to smart locks would bridge a growing gap between supply and demand. Some 61% of Gen Y-ers say they would rent an apartment precisely for its electronic access features. In fact, when combined with other smart home features like learning thermostats and motion-sensing lights, smart locks will spur ⅕ more in rent from interested residents. Given their potential to boost revenue and maximize convenience, smart locks will definitely be a worthwhile amenity as prices keep dropping. Now’s the time for multifamily executives to monitor falling smart lock prices and decide the right moment to budget for this worthwhile amenity. There’s no doubt in my mind: with smart locks, the future is happier! • • • By 2028, I’m convinced artificial intelligence and image recognition will truly change the game for multifamily unit inspections. Within the next ten years, smart inspection apps will be able to turn a single photo into a full-fledged encyclopedia. Yes, the future is that happy! Picture this: a technician enters a unit, takes out a smartphone, and snaps a shot of a washing machine’s serial number. Then, through image recognition and artificial technology, the phone recognizes the machine’s specifications, reveals its repair history, indicates upcoming work required, and ultimately offers how-to guides on ways to fix the appliance. And wait — there’s more. Once the maintenance tech discovers which parts are the problem, the smart inspection app could quickly present a series of replacement options (including costs and delivery estimates). These days, maintenance techs working on a large property lose a lot of time during inspections when they have to return to the office for forgotten tools, replacement parts, or repair instructions. Luckily, rapid strides in AI suggest none of those detours will be necessary ten years down the line. We already live in a world where a smart oven can recognize 50 different foods and know exactly how to turn them into dinner. The possibilities for multifamily are just as exciting. After all, I don’t just see artificial intelligence connecting the dots for a single appliance. I see it connecting the dots for entire communities. Within the decade, we’ll have smart inspection apps that reveal a burst of information right from the front door. That’s where a technician would snap a photo and let image recognition meet cloud technology in a powerful way. The smartphone would quickly showcase resident names, pet information, inspection history, and which visits are scheduled on that floor or elsewhere in the building. Before even entering the unit, the property manager or technician would have a wealth of information at their fingertips. If they were stopping by for a fire safety visit, they might also discover it’s an ideal time to check carpet condition for an approaching turn. With a cutting-edge mobile platform like this, managers can start making the most cost-effective decisions to keep communities safe and revenue rising. For all of these reasons, I promise: the future is happier!

The only way to know is to test and validate. Enter #TechPointBuild First event the team and I will attend this year. It was a great opportunity to introduce our solution to the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Decked in our traditional blue colours the team was easy to approach and willing to engage. I learnt quite a great deal from our participation. Here’s my biggest takeaway: Arouse Curiosity A brand is only as good as people know it. Just two months off the shelf, I was happy those who know us recalled us with ease. Those who didn’t, showed interest and were willing to engage. This made conversation straight forward. We were also able to answer questions and provide clarity. You can’t communicate enough. Our Model is Risky Engaging with seasoned techpreneurs with more years on their belt, It was clear we had a novel model. This isn’t new to us as a team, as it helps us remain different from competition and stay innovative. Novel is risky, but so is being normal. The feel is our model will make us sink or fly, depends on execution. I guess we have our work cut out for us. The Numbers Behind the Story Should Count We bring verified service providers- blue collar, white collar, no-collar- under one roof to be conveniently contacted by all on the go. While our proposition raised interests, what really gave us the applause was the fact that we have almost a thousand sign-ups on and over 2 million naira trackable transactions over our platform, since our soft launch under two months ago. As one colleague told me, “Everyone can dream, but bringing that dream to life is what makes it count. The numbers ensure the story isn’t just zobo”. Apt advice. We are poised to pursue and measure all the metrics that matter. Be Ready, Really — Work on that Elevator Pitch I wasn’t. But when the call was made to pitch ideas, I was up stage even before I could gather my thoughts. I had to sell AtYourService.NG This has taught me to be ready, and so should you. Craft out an elevator pitch, you never can tell when it will come in handy. Techpoint Build is an event I would most definitely attend again. Hopefully as we grow the AtYourService brand, we will be able to give back what we learn. The event was a great avenue to meet, cross-polinate ideas and plant the seeds for future collaboration.

While complex issues about social platforms will continue to be debated, there’s something simpler that can be discussed: the vast majority of people worldwide use social media platforms, but it’s really not a requirement. We engage with social media platforms because they provide us with some social benefit. But here’s something else to keep in mind: in exchange for free use of these platforms, our views are their product. Because they need to have you see more and more ads and paid content, there is a dark side: social platforms intentionally consume our attention through addictive design patterns. Free to use, hard to put down. In the interest of your mental wellbeing and informing the digital habits you can control, I want to think with you about a few topics: And that’s the takeaway here: the more you are aware of what’s going on behind the curtain, the better you can make decisions on how and how often you choose to interact. “Technology makes a great servant, but a poor master.” Getting people to think about the “quality” of time with technology has gained steam over the past few years, led by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who co-founded The Center for Humane Technology and the Time Well Spent movement. “Time Well Spent” is really just an equation of maximizing good, wholesome content in the least amount of time. So how do platforms affect this? On one side, people’s content is what drives social platforms.I’m not saying that social media platforms are no good for letting us share and interact with each other, or specifically the worst ways to interact with people. But research has been growing over the past few years about the impacts of constant social media use — negatively affecting stress, mood, anxiety, depression, or worse. And I’m sure you’ve experienced many emotions using these platforms. But it’s people and organizations that create the content, whether positive or negative. So, you’ll have to decide if your reaction to the content brings you joy, or not. (It’s true that platforms do contribute to the dark content side of the equation, that’s a huge and complicated issue that will show up frequently in the news). The other part of the equation is time spent. And here the platforms very much are dragging down the outcome for all of us, because they are explicitly designed to increase the time you use them in many ways, with no consideration to the quality of what you experience — cats in 360°, live cat videos, AR cats, and more crazy groups than you can imagine! Let’s take a look at what they are doing. Gambling can be exciting for many but absolutely crushing for some — taken to the extreme, this compulsive behavior separates people from their family and friends–but also from their money and potentially everything they own. So it might be more logical that regulation is in place for these industries, but the fact is that social platforms (and games as well) use features that exploit many of the same psychological triggers that are highly addictive. Tons of research has been done to understand the psychology and physiology of people — and your brain has evolved in ways that make it pay attention to different situations and stimuli. And in case you think that the Facebook creators didn’t know what they were doing with that information, here’s a quote from 2017 by Sean Parker (the first president of Facebook and now a self-described “conscientious objector” of social media). Sean Parker said that during development, the objective was “how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible? … we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you … more likes and comments.” ❶ Self-relevant feedback and positive reinforcement. People are by design self-conscious and seek social validation. This isn’t “vanity,” it’s way deeper at our survival core. And social platforms feed right into our need to be liked. ❷ Reputation and social rank. You don’t just want to know how people feel about you, you also want others to know how people feel about you: ❸ FOMO, or fear of missing out. It gets worse. Having social anxiety about things that are specifically not about you — people worry that their peers are doing fun things (getting rewarded) without them (and maybe they are not important to a relationship) — and thus creates a strong desire to stay continuously connected. ❹ Anticipation, and the uncertainty of reward. Everyone loves rewards, and like rats or pigeons pressing levers has taught us, when the reward is randomly provided we’re hard-wired to anticipate and work for it even harder. ❺ Endless content, no dry spells. There’s always an infinite amount of content to be had. Maybe you’re able to prioritize it some and see personal things first, but the flow never ever ends. There’s a certain “zoning out” feeling we love about flow. ❻ Solitary use (don’t bug me). Even though you might be interacting with other people you know online, the personal nature of you and your device can shut out “distractions” in the real world, like talking to someone next to you (who might also be just browsing on their own phone). It’s somewhat subtle but we’re taught to not interrupt people who are engaged with reading a book, watching TV, having a conversation, or using their phone. In 2018, in response to growing pressure about the negative effects of people interacting with bad content and poor controls on our private data, social platforms have actually made some changes. However, rather than do anything significant about their addictive features, or helping you really adjust the quality of your content, they’ve mostly made some data about time spent available to users. Facebook. In August of 2018 Facebook added a “Your Time on Facebook” feature to their mobile apps which gives you feedback on how much time you’ve spent in the last week. The feature gives you some viewing preferences, and lets you set a reminder when you’ve used it more than you set. It also gives you control over some forms of notifications. Instagram. About the same time as Facebook, Instagram added an “Activity” section to its app, which lets you see how much time you spend, and lets you set a reminder when you’ve used it more than you set. It also has a setting for temporarily suppressing notifications. YouTube now has “Time watched” to let you see only aggregate time-watched stats and set a break reminder, but only on the YouTube mobile phone app. What you should be changing there is turning off the “Autoplay,” which is on by default. Twitter really only has the most basic of controls, less about helping manage your time, and more about trying to tune up an unstructured feed that really has no organization. After lots of complaints, they finally allowed people to switch back to a time-based flow vs. the mystery “top Tweets.” Bearing in mind that both platforms have had various 3rd-party apps over the years (like Moment, Offtime, and Breakfree) designed to help you take time away from your device, focus on other things, or build better habits — finally, in 2018 both platforms weakly addressed the issue themselves in the operating systems. Apple introduced Screen Time settings in iOS 12. It is much broader in informing users about what has been attracting their attention. The feedback categorizes usage into major categories — like reading & reference, vs. social networking — and it lets you drill down into different programs, and set limits on their use. It also shows you how many times you’ve picked up your device, and how many and which apps are pushing out notifications. For children’s devices, parents can limit and extend access, giving new controls over homework and chores. Likewise, Google now has Digital Wellbeing features for Android that work much the same as Apple’s, giving you greater insight into your digital habits. But again, it’s mostly about quantifying the time you spend. I hope I’ve given you some good insight into how these platforms are designed to control your time. And while these platforms have not done enough to assist with the quality of your time, platforms giving you knowledge on how much time you spend is a step in the right direction, to help you decide if you want to change your behavior. That each platform tries to claim that these tools are some important altruistic initiative that has people’s health in mind is a huge stretch. The time settings they provide aren’t useless, but let’s be honest — you’ve been snoozing alarms since grade school, and procrastinating as you see fit. Time is yours to control, and don’t think that any company that sells your eyeballs for ads or data will ever really help peel you away from their platform. Again, I’m not saying that social media platforms are no good and should be avoided at all cost. Social networks can help people’s well-being in many ways — these platforms make it easy to stay connected and feel less lonely, help us express ourselves and get feedback, achieve personal goals, work together with others on a good cause, and provide a place to stay more informed on what’s going on in the world than you might have been otherwise. I’d argue that on the whole people mostly share positive things with others (although there has been some research to suggest that “emotionally unstable individuals use their online social network to help regulate their emotions”–sharing TMI to make themselves feel better). So, it’s up to you. Reducing your use of technology overall can lead to better real-world relationships (especially if you’re not looking at your phone during dinner), it can help you get more and better sleep, it can help you better define boundaries of “downtime.” People who are generally anxious (like myself) can limit access to a whole host of things that make you nervous. And if you take some time to consider the way you use social technology in more positive than negative ways, you’ll increase the proportion of well spent time. Written by",8,11,Our first principle?

4,5004,https://medium.com/geoprotocol/evolution-of-consensus-mechanisms-from-classical-methods-to-local-consensus-b38ca0d3d9f2?source=tag_archive---------101-----------------------,Evolution of consensus mechanisms: from classical methods to local consensus,"The general consensus vs. local consensus, Follow GEO Protocol at:, GEO Protocol, GEO Protocol, GEO Protocol","In the first part of this series of articles, we discussed in detail the classical methods of achieving consensus, in the second part — Nakamoto consensus, used in modern decentralized blockchain systems. Finally, here we look at sharding and local consensus, underpinning the main Layer 2 and Layer 3 multi-hop projects based on state channels and trustlines. As we saw earlier, despite a diversity of approaches the ideal method of achieving consensus does not exist (yet?). At the same time, all these methods differ only in what is considered to constitute “complexity” and “work” in each of them. In other elements, they are quite similar: all the consensus mechanisms listed above set the task of reaching agreement on the state of the network, ideally, between all of its participants (or at least of all active ones). The key word here in this is the word “all”. Precisely herein lies the reason for one of the main challenges of all existing blockchains: namely the scalability and speed of transactions. No matter what consensus algorithm — PoW, DPoS, pBFT or other — a project uses, having a commonly distributed registry, as well as the need to achieve consensus among all active network participants (full nodes), will always impose certain limits on the number of transactions per second. Is there a way to overcome this basic constraint? This is quite hard to imagine from the point of view of classic blockchain projects, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. After all, as we said at the very beginning, universal consensus is one of the basic principles on which all distributed blockchain technology rests, and if we move away from it, will we not actually return to centralized systems? It turns out — no. There are ways to do this by moving away from the principle of universal consensus. One such method is the transition to sharding (network segmentation). Sharding aims to solve the problems of scalability, delays, and throughput of transactions. This is a concept widely used in databases to increase their effectiveness. A segment (shard) is a horizontal part of a database, each of which is stored in a separate server. This distributes the load and makes the database more efficient. In the case of blockchain systems, with the implementation of the sharding solution, each node will have only a portion of the blockchain data, and not all the information of the entire blockchain. Nodes that support a segment store information only about that segment in a distributed form, so decentralization is still maintained within the segment. However, each node does not store complete information on the whole blockchain, and that contributes to scalability. This leads to the fact that the Proof of Work algorithm cannot be used in conjunction with segmentation, because how can all participating nodes be involved in checking a transaction if each of them has information only on the segment to which this particular node belongs? Therefore, blockchains that implement sharding use the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm (see Part 2). However, in general, sharding is a method more suitable for updating directly the blockchain systems of the basic Layer 1 level. But there is a more radical way to solve scalability problems, and also the interoperability issue of different blockchain ecosystems. This means the implementation of off-chain solutions, i.e. a departure from the need to have a single distributed registry, which makes it possible to move to a local consensus instead of a global one. The essence of a local consensus is that agreement about a particular transaction is not achieved by the entire network, but only between specific participants in this particular transaction, through direct communication between them. It somewhat resembles a strongly simplified version of pBFT, which we mentioned above, in which consensus is also achieved through communication between the nodes. But unlike pBFT, the local consensus involves essentially only the nodes that participate in a specific transaction. And only the final result of all transactions between these nodes (if necessary) is transmitted for writing to the usual blockchain. But, of course, we are not talking about the transfer of value only between two neighboring nodes. Indeed, if necessary, you can create chains of such nodes, making multi-hop payments possible. On such principles and technologies, various multi-hop projects of the Layer 2 and Layer 3 class are built, i.e. special decentralized networks that are overlays over basic blockchain ecosystems (Layer 1), which are designed to solve primarily the above-mentioned scalability problem (Layer 2 — Lightning Network, Raiden, Celer), as well as the interoperability problem (Layer 3 — GEO Protocol, Interledger). Payments in such systems are performed through a chain of state channels and/or trustlines opened between their members. In order to understand how this actually works, let’s turn to the example of the GEO Protocol. All information about the state of the opened channel between two nodes, as well as the history of all transactions between them, is stored locally on these two nodes and, if necessary, is coordinated between them each time by exchanging the one-time keys from the pre-generated key pool. Thus, nodes can repeatedly change the balance of their composite channel (in the GEO Protocol, a state channel and trustline combination is used) without needing to refer to other nodes, not to mention all the other nodes of the network. If a problem occurs, there are local conflict resolution mechanisms, but if for some reason they have failed, the nodes can apply for arbitration to special service nodes (the so-called observers). In the case of channel closure, its final balance is fixed by both nodes and, if necessary (in the case of the use of the state channel), is passed to be written to an external blockchain (or blockchains, if operations with several assets took place). Conclusion The nature of the first level blockchain systems (Layer 1) is that in order for them to function properly, they are forced to put up with a multitude of design constraints, many of which cannot be overcome. In a sense, these restrictions are not the only natural but also necessary. The need to reach a general consensus refers precisely to such necessary restrictions. At the same time, to improve usability, as well as market adoption of blockchain technology, there is a need to create special overlays over basic ecosystems (Layer 2 and 3), whose task is primarily to overcome the problems of scalability and interoperability of various blockchain systems, as well as their integration with existing solutions of the real economy. The architecture of Layer 2 and 3 systems allows the use of technologies other than those used in conventional blockchain systems. These technologies include the local consensus method.

The technology needs of these businesses are undergoing a sea change posing a massive challenge to the IT services organizations building solutions for them. The customer’s expectation from IT services organisations is therefore changing from plain project execution and SLA adherence to “Ownership of Value”, “Outcome based models” and “Product mindset”. This calls for agile teams with knowledge and skills on digital technologies, full technology stacks, user experience design, micro-services based architecture, design thinking, and product engineering. But, the impact of Digital Transformation is not restricted to the IT workforce alone. In fact, the World Economic Forum terms it the Fourth Industrial Revolution — and it is impacting the global workforce across all sectors. As per its updated Future of Jobs 2018 report, it highlights that the “Global average skills stability — the proportion of core skills required to perform a job that will remain the same — is expected to be about 58%, meaning an average shift of 42% in required workforce skills over the 2018–2022 period.” Further, the report goes onto estimate that almost 54% of all employees will require significant reskilling and upskilling. It’s an imperative that businesses take the lead in supporting their own workforce to reskill and upskill, but it’s even more important that working professionals take charge of their own competency development and embrace a culture of lifelong learning. Organizations and governments must invest in creating a 360° learning ecosystem. However, current strategies, as indicated by the WEF report suggest that those most in need of reskilling and upskilling are the least likely to receive such training, as organizations prioritize their immediate needs and short-term goals and objectives. In fact, our own experience working with many leading organizations in India, also shows that while some immediate needs are being addressed, efforts are falling short of the width & depth of interventions required. Moreover, it is unclear whether the efforts will result in a sustainable learning ecosystem that will keep pace with the rapid changes that will continue to happen in the many technology areas that makeup the digital transformation landscape. In my view an organization wide talent transformation program has to holistically address the needs of: 1. Fresh talent that is being on-boarded at an entry level 2. New talent being inducted at a lateral level 3. Existing people who are working on projects 4. Existing people who are in-between projects Making a deep and impactful change across the organization is a key imperative for the learning and development teams. But given the scale of operations of leading organizations, 4 key constraints need to be overcome: 1. Time: The disruptive new technologies present a significant learning curve. For example, in key developer roles we estimate an initial effort of 500–800 hours of learning and practice to get up to speed and an additional 250–300 hours annually for the next 2–3 years to remain current. This quantum of learning is way beyond traditional estimates and capacity that most organizations have created. This problem gets accentuated further for the people who are deployed on existing projects and have minimal time available for learning. 2. Reach: Across numerous geographies and multiple modes required to address employees in a variety of roles — from client facing team members, to people on the bench, to fresh graduates who have just been hired. 3. Experts: Lack of availability of experts and practitioners, who have the cutting edge skills, for training, coaching, and mentoring. Scarce experts are most in demand for billable client engagements. 4. Costs: Given the time, reach, and expertise constraints to be overcome, the additional costs are significant. A model that not only addresses the learning challenges faced by employees, but also addresses the motivational and economic issues to create a win-win solution for the organization as well as the employee. A model that transforms existing employees and ensures they have “Project-ready Digital Skills”. In anticipation of the demand for digital skills and the industry need for a solution to address the problem of rapid skills development in this area, NIIT launched StackRoute in 2015. StackRoute runs boot camps and workshops that produce exceptional Full Stack Developers and Digital Architects. At StackRoute, participants go through the experience of building and releasing a real technology product. This is done in an immersive environment where participants experience what it takes to visualize, design, build, and release a new product. The transition from believing “I cannot do this” to demonstrating “here is what I have built” changes people. Our Mastery learning model assures, with 90% probability, that our graduates are readily deployable on digital opportunities and projects. An approach that is showing promise in many organizations that have started their digital re-skilling journey is as follows: 1. Credible assessment and calibration process that assesses the target group of employees and establishes the current baseline of skills and determines the gap that needs to be bridged. 2. Differentiated learning plans and investments tailored to individual needs. 3. Expert counselling to “enroll” participants into the journey of transformation and the effort & discipline that will be required of them. This is an important, but oft neglected step that ensures that participants are not under any false illusions about the effort that will be required on their part 4. Balanced economic model that equitably addresses the needs of the organization with that of the participants while ensuring that there is no mindset of entitlement. 5. Attractive yet credible outcomes that are transparent and indisputable. Clear demonstration of the transformational learning outcomes and the confidence that the gains can be carried forward into live projects. It is abundantly clear that traditional models of training, which result in sub-optimal outcomes for a majority of the learners, are insufficient. Instead a coherent strategy and an approach that guarantees results, while addressing the constraints highlighted earlier, is needed. Only when Learning Outcomes can be delivered at scale, will Boards and CEOs have the confidence to sign-off on the large re-skilling investments required!

Comment lui donner la capacité d’imaginer et de réaliser quelque chose de nouveau, alors même qu’aussi aboutie soit l’intelligence artificielle elle reste le produit de nos propres suppositions de comment se construit notre intelligence, et donc, de fait, condamnée aux limites de notre propre imagination ? À ces questions, les GANs (les réseaux adverses génératifs, en anglais, generative adversarial networks) ne répondent pas, mais proposent néanmoins des éléments de réponses. Les GANs sont des réseaux de neurones artificiels permettant de générer de nouvelles images. Leur spécificité est d’être composés de deux réseaux : un générateur dont l’objectif est de générer à partir de « bruit » (une suite de cordonnées dans un espace à n dimensions) des images susceptibles de tromper le discriminateur — un autre réseau qui dispose d’un jeu d’images et qui, face à la production du générateur, lui fournit une réponse comprise entre 0 et 1 lui indiquant le degré de similitude avec la base de données dont il dispose. Ainsi, à partir de la réponse du discriminateur, le générateur par itération déduit vers où sa « créativité » doit s’orienter. Il diverge puis converge. À ce titre, le GAN emprunte à nos processus bien humains de créativité, avec néanmoins une limite forte : si la phase de convergence se prolonge, le processus devient un entonnoir réducteur qui tend vers la copie. C’est un peu comme si nous entrainions ces réseaux comme on enseignait l’art par la mimesis dans les écoles Classiques mais sans la capacité de s’en affranchir. Même si cet enseignement n’a plus cours, il persiste avec l’idée postmoderne de référence et de création par la recombinaison de formes précédemment explorées. Ronan Barrot n’aime pas cette idée de voir « l’histoire de l’art comme une batterie de casseroles dans laquelle faire sa tambouille » mais comme tout artiste il dispose d’un corpus d’images ou de références qui l’ont marquées et dans lequel il puise. La particularité est que ces images viennent à lui plus qu’il ne va à elles. Comme atteint d’une forme rare d’apophénie limitée à sa peinture, Ronan Barrot attribue un sens particulier à un rythme, une couleur. Des liens se dessinent avec son inconscient iconographique, des références s’invitent et des hybridations de tableaux précédents apparaissent. Il intègre ou réfute ce qui se convoque à lui en orientant son chaos de couleurs dans une direction plutôt qu’une autre jusqu’à ce que motif se forme. Ce procédé est d’autant plus manifeste avec les Crânes. Ils émergent de chaque nettoyage de palette, leur matière première leur est imposée par les autres tableaux en cours. Dans le chaos de couleurs initial, le regard de Ronan Barrot cherche, non un autre regard, tout juste des orbites, suffisantes pour qu’une tête humaine se distingue. Les premières images produites par le GAN de Robbie Barrat — artiste, chercheur en intelligence artificielle engagé dans un dialogue avec Ronan Barrot grâce au concours de l’Avant Galerie — n’ont aucun sens pour nous. C’est là aussi un chaos de couleur confronté à un corpus — celui du jeu de données dont dispose le réseau, dans ce cas 500 peintures de crânes de Ronan Barrot — puis, d’une exploration à tâtons émergent des formes de plus en plus ressemblantes aux Crânes de Ronan. Sauf que plus la machine reproduit des formes existantes moins elle explore, moins elle est créative. Il est impératif que Robbie intervienne pour interrompre le processus et extraire du flux ininterrompu d’images générées celles dignes d’exister pour elles mêmes. Le réseau ne produit pas une suite d’images uniques. Il ne produit pas non plus une série formant un tout. Il produit un continuum, un flux d’itérations, chacune unique mais dont la finalité est à rechercher non pas dans l’unicité mais dans l’itération elle-même. Un algorithme n’a ni aura, ni autorité et ne dispose pas de capacité de transcendance. Il ne produit pas d’idées, ne fait pas Art. À ce jeu là, seul le désir humain est de taille. Le désir de choisir une teinte inédite, un accord de couleurs séduisant ou une forme intrigante. L’humain par ses choix est partout. Chaque concession à l’un de ces crânes à accéder à une existence matérielle est l’acte créateur d’un avatar d’une œuvre plus globale. Le choix forme ces œuvres. Elles existent tant pour elles mêmes que comme signes du réseau et des suites de choix dont elles résultent, en somme, elles sont œuvres et clés d’entrée dans l’œuvre. L’autre clé d’entrée, celle de la porte dérobée, c’est le contenu de la base de données. L’altération ou la modification du dataset est le seul outil de communication directe avec la machine. Pour Epoch 1– la première génération de crânes générés par le GAN de Robbie Barrat — la base était composée d’une sélection de Crânes de Ronan Barrot présentés à la machine dans un seul sens, celui dans lequel nous regardons ces crânes. Par ce dataset, la machine est contrainte de ne considérer ces images que de la seule manière dont nous humains nous les regardons. À l’inverse, pour Epoch 2– la seconde génération, de format carré — des images des crânes dans tous les sens et en miroir sont proposées à la machine. En affranchissant la machine du regard humain et de nos propres biais de perception, on étend sa capacité d’exploration, sa capacité à nous surprendre, sa capacité de créativité. Le réseau s’approprie véritablement le corpus initial, il le copie, le rogne, le réinterprète, le reformate, le recrée et, par la même occasion, gagne en fluidité. Il n’est plus contraint par le format car à quoi servent les dimensions quand l’image s’affiche à la taille de l’écran. Ce que l’image perd en auramatérielle, elle le gagne en fluidité. Quant à l’œuvre, elle y gagne l’illusion de l’infini. On entraperçoit cette notion d’infini face à la démultiplication des crânes. Chacun d’eux est unique mais nous ne sommes pas en capacité de nous en rendre compte. Pourtant, ils ne sont pas si nombreux — près de 8000 crânes en tout dont 101 avec une existence matérielle. Toutefois, le vertige de la masse et la nausée de la répétition du motif nous saisissent. Le concept d’infini n’est pas facilement appréhendable car non représentable ou quantifiable mais il est amusant qu’un si petit nombre nous y donne accès. Et il est doublement amusant que ce soit par le motif du crâne, allégorie de notre finitude. De nombreuses parallèles fructueuses peuvent être tracées entre les processus de Robbie et Ronan — le flux de crânes « sous-produit » d’une œuvre, l’itération plutôt que la série, la relation à un corpus — mais c’est dans la confrontation entre la « nécessité intérieure » de peindre et la machine que de nouvelles frontières se dessinent. Va-t-on conférer le même degré d’authenticité à des œuvres qui s’affranchissent des exigences d’intentionnalité et d’intériorité ? La réponse n’est pas claire. À l’instar de Walter Benjamin lors de sa rédaction deL’Œuvre d’art à l’époque de sa reproductibilité technique, on oscille entre diagnostic optimiste désireux de voir les mutations futures de l’Art et nostalgie de cette fleur bleue — la continuité matérielle de l’œuvre avec le corps de l’artiste — perdue. Caroline Vossen et Albertine Meunier, « partner » et « partner in data crime », ont rendus possible cette rencontre entre Ronan Barrot et Robbie Barrat. Infinite Skulls est une exposition exceptionnelle à plus d’un titre : c’est la première qu’organise l’Avant Galerie et la première issue du dialogue entre artistes, galeriste et intelligence artificielle — une exposition œuvre commune en somme.

The underside of the patch has a tiny hole that allows sweat to enter; while a myriad of separate microfluidic channels push the sweat to an internal sensor where it is analyzed. An embedded NFC chip can then transmit the data to a mobile device that medical professionals can use to view the results. Each microfluidic channel serves as different miniature test lab — with one for fluid levels, another for chloride concentration, another for sweat loss, and so forth. The sweat is mixed with different chemicals within the micro-channels, causing it to change different colors, each representing that specific test, allowing athletes to see body chemistry changes in real-time. Besides sending the collected data wirelessly to a mobile device for further analysis, the wearer could also take a pic of the patch, and an app could tell them if they need to drink more water or risk dehydration, something that can happen even while swimming. The wearable sweat sensors are already in clinical use at the Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, where they are used to screen newborns for cystic fibrosis through measuring chloride levels in their sweat. They will also be fielded to athletes to put them through ‘extreme test-cases’ before they become available to the market.

It is the Blockchain” — Harvard Business Review. But, will Blockchain really impact in our lives as Internet did? After some time researching around the ins and outs of Blockchain through different sources, I think I have concentrated the most important points to understand the big possibilities of this technology, which will transform sectors such as financial, energy or security. It will stir up any organization in which transactions are usually used, ultimately. First things first … What is Blockchain? Blockchain, also known as DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) is a decentralized mechanism that keeps track of all transactions made between two or more nodes in a network, in a secure and distributed way. It is nothing more than a great accounting book that is replicated in the machines of all the participants of a network, making impossible to modify the information contained in it, and which only users with permission can access, turning it into a shared source of truth. The mystery … Who created Blockchain? All great stories hide mysteries, conspiracy theories, and different enigmas. Blockchain has all the necessary ingredients to turn its birth into a legend. On Halloween 2008, several hundred people belonging to different cryptographic communities received an email with the following sender: Satoshi Nakamoto. He informed them that he had been working on a system that eliminated the need for trust intermediaries when making transactions, and solved the problem of double spending. All this was explained in the paper: “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. The first cryptographic currency based on Blockchain was created. And unlike most entrepreneurs and CxOs of the world’s largest multinationals, which feed the dreamers with their success stories in their search of success, its creator decided to remain anonymous. But … What did Satoshi Nakamoto explain in his paper? Until recently, whenever we needed to make a transaction, we had some central authority or third party that acted as an intermediary. Whether it was in the payment of an asset online, in the change of a property’s name, or when patenting a product, we relied on the truthfulness of banks, notaries or any other organization. Blockchain involves a paradigm shift in this system, by introducing a peer-to-peer exchange mechanism in a distributed and secure way, thanks to the cryptographic algorithm on which it is based. When several actors that are part of a Blockchain distributed network decide to exchange value (cryptographic currency, property title, etc.), a new block composed of a set of transactions is sent to all the nodes that participate in the network. At that moment, those nodes initiate the verification process, which consists in verifying that the information contained in the block is valid and that the bases of the agreed terms have not been altered. Once the majority of the nodes have validated it, the block is sealed with a cryptographic hash (algorithm) based on the information that contains and the previous block hash. Thus, the manipulation or alteration of the data contained in each of the blocks that are part of the chain is fairly impossible, and an immutable record is obtained, a source of truth. In an effort to get a large number of nodes involved in the verification process, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a system of miners. These users keep a copy of the chain in their machines, from where they use its compute capacity to calculate the complex mathematical operations necessary to incorporate a new block in the chain. Then, those miners who get the solution, obtain a great monetary reward. This process is called Proof of Work. Moreover, in most data centers around the world, the databases are replicated to prevent a single point of failure and to provide high availability to the service. It is an expensive solution, but essential for any organization that handles sensitive data. In the case of Blockchain and due to its distributed nature, all the nodes that are part of the network have a copy of the blocks, avoiding a single point of failure and making insignificant the probability of data loss. “Permissionless” and “Permissioned” Blockchain Even though one of the first applications of Blockchain was Bitcoin, many other implementations of this technology have already been found. In the case of cryptographic currencies, the Blockchain network is public. Any user can join and obtain a copy of all transactions in the chain and participate in the verification process. On the other hand, it is also possible to create a private Blockchain network, in which only users with an invitation have access to the information contained in it and can participate in the validation process. Currently, several open source initiatives such as Ethereum, Corda or Hyperledger Fabric, have developed their own implementations of Blockchain, making life easier for developers by providing different tools and frameworks. Other private companies, such as Oracle, have also put in place solutions based on this powerful technology. Let’s give an example Once we have an understanding of how a Blockchain public network such as Bitcoin works, let’s see one practical application of a private network. On this link, you will find the complete analysis of this case, which was modeled using the Blockchain service in the Oracle Cloud. To improve the components’ traceability of their vehicles, a car manufacturer has integrated Blockchain with four of its dealers, creating the following network: The car manufacturer is the founder of the Blockchain network, and the four dealers participate in it: Whenever a vehicle’s component is sold by one of the suppliers to the manufacturer, and once the transaction is approved by both parties, the transaction is registered in the Blockchain network. Thus, a large database shared between the parties is obtained, in a secure and unalterable way. Moreover, the dealers only have access to the information of their components, but not to those of other dealers. This is just a simple practical example, that helps to understand better the countless applications that Blockchain has. For example, this solution in place would have avoided the scandal over the illegal installation of software that Volkswagen carried out to eleven million vehicles, in order to manipulate the results of the technical controls of polluting emissions. With a source of truth like Blockchain, it would have been possible to track the supply chain of all the cars, from the manufacturer to the customer, avoiding the manipulation in any of its phases. Last but not least … What are the Smart Contracts? Conventionally, contracts are used to close agreements between two or more parties. In Blockchain’s world, the Smart Contracts define the rules of the agreed terms and execute the outcomes automatically, without the need for an intermediary institution. The Smart Contracts are scripts that can be programmed in different programming languages such as Java or Go, and that verify that when any of the conditions described in the contract is satisfied, the transaction is made. Imagine that you decide to bet five euros on the fact that Real Madrid will win the next game against Barcelona, and another person bets the same amount to the opposite case. With a Smart Contract in place between the two parts, the result of the game would be verified automatically, and the money would be sent to the winner. In this sense, no intermediaries neither a third party would be needed to act as an arbitrator. Absolute truth does not exist … or does it? Blockchain is the first source of distributed and inalterable truth. A large public database globally. Secure and collaborative. There is no doubt that it is time to get on board with this amazing technology, in which the developer’s community will have a decisive role, not only in its growth but also in its transformation and evolution. This sounds great, but … How can I get started and try it? Oracle’s Blockchain service is available within the free 30-days Trial. Furthermore, there are many other solutions available to test.

10,5010,https://medium.com/ternion/is-regtech-the-future-of-regulatory-compliance-b50c2b9d678e?source=tag_archive---------107-----------------------,Is RegTech the Future of Regulatory Compliance?,"Ternion Exchange, Ternion","Governments around the world are constantly changing and updating legal regulations to account for potential disruptions in the financial system that the emerging technologies open it exposed to. As a result, companies have to meet an elevated threshold of being transparent about its financial practices (think AML and KYC), collection, sharing and retention of user data, privacy notices, cookie policies, etc. Compliance is not easily achieved in a time-pressing and constantly changing the legal environment. At least not manually. RegTech might be the answer to newly found struggles of such companies. According to the Medici report, as more companies want to streamline and automate their compliance mechanisms, the demand for regulatory technology solutions is expected to reach $118.7 billion by 2020. What is RegTech exactly? Although technology has been used at various levels in the regulatory affairs for over 20 years, new, more sophisticated software changed RegTech quite drastically and made more adept for modern legal realities. RegTech is an amalgamation of the words ‘Regulatory’ and ‘Technology’. It refers to the use of technology to assist companies in their compliance quest. RegTech offers agility — cluttered data sets can be organized through ETL (Extract, Transfer Load) technologies. RegTech’s technology can also quickly flex and update the system as the new regulations come in. It also opens a different way to utilize data. RegTech uses analytic tools to intelligently mine existing “big data” sets and use the extracted data for multiple purposes. Some RegTech developers try to teach the software to analyze the outcomes of the regulations previously adopted for a seamless adoption and analysis of new regulations. As Sean Smith, a partner in the Risk Advisory department of Deloitte, puts it, “In the short term RegTech will help firms to automate the more mundane compliance tasks and reduce operational risks associated with meeting compliance and reporting obligations. In the longer term, it will empower compliance functions to make informed risk choices based on data provided insight about the compliance risks it faces and how it mitigates and manages those risks”. For Blockchain fans Blockchain fever did not slip through the RegTech developers’ minds. Some RegTech solutions use Blockchain. As a virtue of the Blockchain’s near real-time settlement capability achieved through automation and global consensus, RegTech solutions can automate compliance aspects in cases such as identity management and transaction processing, settlement and reporting. To conclude, RegTech is rapidly developing and it seems to provide an adequate and swift compliance mechanism to companies. The irony that shouldn’t be left unseen is that technology has indirectly contributed to the enhanced level of accountability that is being demanded from companies. It seems that technology is a tool, simultaneously capable of igniting and putting out fires it creates.
